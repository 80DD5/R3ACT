## Essential Requirements

To run the scripts:
   - Ensure AutoHotkey 1.1 (AHK) is installed.
   - Download AHK from the [official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
   - For an enhanced experience, use Sublime Text for editing configuration files.

## General Information

*Hotkeys:*
- **Start:** F9
- **Pause/Coordinates:** F10
- **Resume/Config:** F11
- **Exit:** F12

*Note: The folders are categorized by Skill and then Activity within that. The installation process involves:*
   1. Download the R3ACT repository.
   2. Place the repository folder (R3ACT) somewhere convenient.
   3. Navigate to the desired script folder based on Skill -> Activity.
   4. Edit the 'Config' file to suit your needs (coordinates for clicking can be defined later using the GUI once the script is run).
   5. Compile the AHK script.
   6. Run the script.
   7. Edit Coordinates if required.
   8. Enter the desired amount of times to complete the activity and enjoy.

## Configuration Customization

Users can extensively customize the configuration for each script using the PULSE framework. Specific elements that are configurable include time-delays, randomness, click locations, length of time ran, and different item and activity settings within single scripts through the provided config file. This allows users to tailor scripts according to their preferences, providing a high degree of flexibility and personalization.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? [open an issue](https://github.com/B0DD5/R3ACT/issues). The step-by-step installations are provided to avoid common pitfalls during setup and execution.

## Security Measures

*Important:* This toolkit is provided "as-is," and users should be aware of the risks associated with using third-party tools in online games. Follow best practices to minimize risks, such as avoiding prolonged usage (running the bot for too long) and refraining from using it on accounts you're not willing to lose. Ensure proper breaks (separate from the in-built AFK timers) to avoid detection, as no human plays 18+ hours a day, 7 days a week regularly.
