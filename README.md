# R3ACT - RuneScape 3 Automation and Configuration Toolkit

## Introduction

Welcome to R3ACT, your ultimate RuneScape 3 Automation and Configuration Toolkit, designed to streamline the scripting experience, offering options, customizability, and ease of use. R3ACT primarily focuses on enhancing money-making methods outlined on the RSÂ£ Wiki Page.

## PULSE - Precision Utilities for Low-level Scripting Efficiency

PULSE serves as the backbone of R3ACT, aiming to simplify the configuration process of scripting. It functions as "Precision Utilities for Low-level Scripting Efficiency," allowing users to easily run scripts while providing individual customization options. PULSE takes users away from the complexity of R3ACT's code, emphasizing user-friendly customization.

## Core Advantages

1. **Streamlined Automation:**
   - Free up your time by allowing easy execution of scripts without intricate user interventions. Just choose a skill or activity to bot, run the script with guidance through the user interface and notes.

2. **Customizable Scripts:**
   - Leverage the open-source framework of PULSE to customize scripts according to your preferences. Customize time-delays, randomness, click locations, length of time ran, and differentiate item and activity settings within single scripts through the provided config file.

3. **Enhanced Convenience:**
   - Enjoy in-game convenience with features like portable renewals, crafting efficiency, and combat actions. The advantage of PULSE allows users to focus on adjusting settings in the PULSE Config and Config files, avoiding direct modifications to scripts.

## Getting Started with R3ACT

Initiating R3ACT is a straightforward process. Access the latest version from the GitHub repository and follow the provided documentation for a seamless setup.

### Script Usage Note

No need to modify the scripts directly; concentrate on the PULSE Config and Config files.

### Essential Requirements

To run the scripts in this project, ensure you have AutoHotkey 1.1 (AHK) installed on your system. All scripts are provided in an uncompiled format, requiring AHK for execution. Download AutoHotkey from the [official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

For an enhanced and streamlined experience, we recommend using Sublime Text for editing configuration files.
